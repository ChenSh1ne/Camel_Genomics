# Window-based analysis of genetic variation.
The following code is for calculating various measures of genetic variation across sliding windows.  The code is based on python scripts to manipulate window-based approaches on VCF files of genomic variant data.  The python scripts are hosted on [Simon Martin's GitHub Page](https://github.com/simonhmartin/genomics_general).

First, install Simon Martin's 'genomics_general' toolset:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/simonhmartin/genomics_general.git
```
